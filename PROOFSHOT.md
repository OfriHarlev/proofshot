# ProofShot Visual Verification

ProofShot is an open-source, agent-agnostic CLI that lets any AI coding agent verify its own work in a real browser — no vendor lock-in required.

After building or modifying UI features, verify with this workflow:

1. Start: `proofshot start --run "your-dev-command" --port PORT --description "what you are verifying"`
   If the server is already running, omit --run.
2. Test: Use `proofshot exec` to navigate, click, fill forms, take screenshots
3. Stop: `proofshot stop` — bundles video, screenshots, and error report

ProofShot keeps all `proofshot exec` commands inside the same isolated `agent-browser` session that was created by `proofshot start`, so recording, screenshots, and browser actions stay aligned.
ProofShot verifies the active browser URL and viewport immediately after recording starts. If that state is wrong, it fails early instead of continuing into misleading screenshots.
ProofShot sets viewport size through `agent-browser set viewport <width> <height> [scale]`. If your screenshots need a specific device pixel ratio, configure `viewport.deviceScaleFactor` in `proofshot.config.json`.

Key proofshot exec commands:
- `proofshot exec snapshot -i` — see interactive elements
- `proofshot exec click @e3` — click an element
- `proofshot exec fill @e2 "text"` — fill a form field
- `proofshot exec screenshot step.png` — capture a moment

Artifacts saved to ./proofshot-artifacts/ including video, screenshots, errors, and summary.

Use `proofshot doctor` when the local setup looks wrong. It prints the current config path, browser mode, viewport, installed binaries, and any active ProofShot session.
You can customize browser launch behavior in `proofshot.config.json`, including HTTPS error ignoring and a custom browser executable path.
If your environment is slower than the defaults, add a `timeouts` section to `proofshot.config.json` to increase browser open, exec, or video trim timeouts.
